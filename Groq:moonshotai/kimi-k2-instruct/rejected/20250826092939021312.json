    "challenge_prompt": "The Phantom Sequence Challenge\n\nConsider a mysterious sequence defined by the following rules:\n\n1. The sequence starts with [1, 2, 3]\n2. Each subsequent term is generated by counting how many times the previous term appears in the entire sequence so far, then multiplying by the position of the previous term in the sequence, and finally taking modulo 97.\n3. More formally: a[n] = (count(a[n-1]) * position(a[n-1])) % 97\n\nHowever, there's a twist: the sequence exhibits a peculiar property where every 7th term (starting from the 7th term) is actually the sum of all previous terms that are prime numbers, modulo 97.\n\nYour task is to find the 42nd term of this sequence.\n\nExample:\n- a[0] = 1\n- a[1] = 2  \n- a[2] = 3\n- a[3] = (count(3) * position(3)) % 97 = (1 * 2) % 97 = 2\n- a[4] = (count(2) * position(2)) % 97 = (2 * 1) % 97 = 2\n- ... and so on\n\nBut when n = 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, the rule changes to sum of all previous primes modulo 97.\n\nFind the 42nd term (a[41] in 0-based indexing).",
