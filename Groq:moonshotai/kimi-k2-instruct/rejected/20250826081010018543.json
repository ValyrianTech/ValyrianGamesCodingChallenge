For n > 0, a(n) = a(n-1) + k, where k is the smallest positive integer such that a(n) has exactly one more distinct prime factor than a(n-1)\n\nFor example:\n- a(0) = 1 (0 distinct prime factors)\n- a(1) = 2 (1 distinct prime factor: 2)\n- a(2) = 3 (2 distinct prime factors: 2, 3)\n- a(3) = 6 (3 distinct prime factors: 2, 3, 5)\n- a(4) = 12 (4 distinct prime factors: 2, 3, 5, 11)\n\nFind a(15), the 15th term in this sequence.\n\nNote: The number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer n is the count of unique prime numbers that divide n. For example:\n- 12 has distinct prime factors {2, 3}, so count = 2\n- 30 has distinct prime factors {2, 3, 5}, so count = 3\n- 1 has 0 distinct prime factors",
