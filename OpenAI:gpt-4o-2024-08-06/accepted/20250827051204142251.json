The sequence is defined as follows:\n\n- Start with two numbers: `a = 1` and `b = 1`.\n- The next number in the sequence is generated by summing the squares of the previous two numbers, i.e., `c = a^2 + b^2`.\n- Continue generating numbers in this manner until the sequence contains at least 20 numbers.\n\nYour task is to find the 5th number in this sequence.",
