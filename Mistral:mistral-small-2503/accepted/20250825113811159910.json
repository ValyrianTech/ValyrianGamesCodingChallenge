    "challenge_prompt": "You are given a sequence of integers. The sequence is defined as follows: it starts with the number 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the digits of the previous number. The sequence continues until a number repeats. Your task is to find the length of the sequence before the first repetition. For example, the sequence starting with 1 is: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ... (repeats at 1). The length of this sequence is 1. However, if the starting number is 2, the sequence is: 2, 4, 8, 16, 23, 35, 44, 53, 44 (repeats at 44). The length of this sequence is 8. Write a Python function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the length of the sequence before the first repetition starts.",
