    "challenge_prompt": "You are given a 5x5 grid where each cell contains an integer. The grid is as follows:\n\n1  2  3  4  5\n6  7  8  9 10\n11 12 13 14 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21 22 23 24 25\n\nYou start at the top-left corner (cell with value 1). You can move right or down (no diagonal moves). Your goal is to reach the bottom-right corner (cell with value 25). However, there's a catch: every time you move to a cell with a value that is a prime number, you must stay in that cell for an extra turn (i.e., you cannot move again until the next turn).\n\nThe score for a path is the sum of all the values of the cells visited, including the starting and ending cells, but counting each prime cell's value twice (since you stay there for an extra turn).\n\nYour task is to find the maximum possible score achievable by any valid path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.\n\nFor this problem, consider the following prime numbers in the range of the grid values (1 to 25): 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.\n\nWrite a program to find the maximum possible score.",
