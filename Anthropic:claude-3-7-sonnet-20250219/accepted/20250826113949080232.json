    "challenge_prompt": "# The Enigmatic Sequence\n\nYou've discovered an ancient mathematical sequence with peculiar properties. The sequence starts with the values 1 and 2, but then follows a mysterious pattern.\n\nHere are the first few terms of the sequence:\n1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 20, 33, 54, 88, 122, ...\n\nAfter careful analysis, you've determined that this sequence follows two different patterns:\n\n1. For the first 9 terms (from the 3rd term to the 9th term), each term is calculated using one formula.\n2. Starting from the 10th term, the sequence suddenly changes and follows a different formula.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Analyze the pattern in the sequence\n2. Determine both recurrence relations\n3. Write a function to calculate the nth term of the sequence\n4. Find the 42nd term of the sequence\n\nThe 42nd term will serve as the password to unlock an ancient vault containing untold wisdom.\n\nHints:\n- For the first part of the sequence, look at how each term relates to the two previous terms\n- For the second part of the sequence, the formula is simpler than you might expect\n- The transition happens exactly at the 10th term\n- Both formulas use only the two preceding terms in different ways",
