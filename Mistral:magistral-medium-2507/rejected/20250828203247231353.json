    "challenge_prompt": "Decode the following message and compute the sum of all the numbers used in the decoding process. This sum will be your final answer as a single integer.\n\nThe message is encoded using a custom encoding scheme where each character is replaced by its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26), and then each number is replaced by its binary representation without leading zeros. The binary representations are concatenated to form the encoded message.\n\nHere is the encoded message:\n`10100010100110010111011011101011100101101111110011011000110111111001101001110`\n\nYour task is to decode this message by splitting the binary string into valid binary representations of numbers between 1 and 26 (without leading zeros), then convert those numbers back to their corresponding letters, and finally compute the sum of all the numbers used in the decoding process. This sum is your final answer.",
