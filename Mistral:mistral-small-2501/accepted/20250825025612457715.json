Repeat this process until the sequence reaches a number that has already appeared in the sequence.\n\nFor example, the sequence starting with 1 would be: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 11, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...\n\nYour task is to find the sum of all numbers in this sequence that are divisible by both 3 and 5.",
