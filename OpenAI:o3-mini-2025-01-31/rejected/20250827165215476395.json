Each number should be counted only once even if it has multiple representations. Your task is to:\n\n1. Find all such distinct perfect powers within the specified range.\n2. Compute the sum of these numbers.\n3. Calculate the sum of the digits of that overall sum.\n\nThe final answer (the password) is the sum of the digits computed in step 3. For instance, if the sum of the perfect powers turned out to be 11853, then the sum of its digits is 1+1+8+5+3 = 18, which would be the expected answer.",
