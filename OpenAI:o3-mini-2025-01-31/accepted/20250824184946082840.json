For example, for n = 312, compute f(312) = 3^1 + 1^2 + 2^3 = 3 + 1 + 8 = 12.\n\nNow, define a sequence {a_k} by:\n\u2022 a_0 is an initial positive integer.\n\u2022 For k \u2265 1, a_k = f(a_{k-1}).\n\nYour task is to start with a_0 = 987654 and repeatedly apply f until the sequence reaches a single-digit number.
