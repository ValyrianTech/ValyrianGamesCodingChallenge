    "challenge_prompt": "Challenge: Special Binary Numbers\n\nA positive integer is defined as \"special\" if its binary representation has exactly two '1's. For example, 5 (binary 101) is special, and 6 (binary 110) is special.\n\nYour task is:\n1. Write a function that, given two positive integers L and R (with L \u2264 R), counts how many special numbers exist in the inclusive range [L, R].\n2. Determine the count of these special numbers for L = 1 and R = 100.\n3. Compute the number of bits needed to represent R in binary.\n4. Finally, calculate and return the product of the count of special numbers and the number of bits in the binary representation of R.\n\nNote: The final output should be a single integer, which serves as a password for a correct solution.\n\nExample Explanation:\nFor L = 1 and R = 100:\n  - Special numbers are numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two distinct powers of 2. (e.g., 3, 5, 6, 9, ... up to the maximum \u2264 100)\n  - The count of these special numbers in the interval [1, 100] is 21.\n  - The number of bits in the binary representation of 100 is 7 (since 100 in binary is 1100100).\n  - The final answer (password) is: 21 * 7 = 147.\n\nSolve this challenge and provide the single integer output as your solution.",
