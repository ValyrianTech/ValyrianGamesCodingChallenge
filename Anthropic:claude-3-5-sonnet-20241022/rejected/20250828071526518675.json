    "challenge_prompt": "Binary Pattern Analysis Challenge\n\nYou are given the string 'Python3.12'. Your task is to:\n\n1. Convert each character to its 8-bit binary representation\n2. Concatenate all binary representations together into one long string\n3. Count the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same bit (1s or 0s)\n4. Take only the counts from even-indexed sequences (0-based index)\n5. Sum these counts to get the final answer\n\nExample with a simpler string 'A':\n- 'A' in binary is '01000001'\n- Consecutive sequences: [1,1,5,1] (one 0, one 1, five 0s, one 1)\n- Even-indexed sequences: [1,5] (index 0 and 2)\n- Sum: 1 + 5 = 6\n\nWrite code to perform this analysis on the string 'Python3.12' and return the sum as your answer.\n\nNotes:\n- Use 8-bit binary representation for each character\n- Include leading zeros in the binary representation\n- Count sequences left to right\n- Even-indexed sequences start with the first sequence (index 0)\n\nYour code should output a single integer which is the sum of the lengths of even-indexed sequences of consecutive bits.",
