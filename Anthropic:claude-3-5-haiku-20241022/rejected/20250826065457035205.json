    "challenge_prompt": "The Harmonic Sequence Cipher: Given a sequence where each number is determined by a unique harmonic rule, find the 2024th number in the sequence. The sequence starts with [1, 1] and follows this cryptic generation rule: each subsequent number is the sum of the reciprocals of all previous numbers' indices, rounded down to the nearest integer. What is the 2024th number in this sequence?",
