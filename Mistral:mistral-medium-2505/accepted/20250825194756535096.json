    "challenge_prompt": "You are given a sequence of numbers that follows a specific pattern. Your task is to determine the next number in the sequence and return it as a single integer. The sequence is as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 22, 155, ?. To solve this, you need to identify the underlying pattern or rule that generates the sequence. Write a Python function that can compute the next number in the sequence and return it. The function should be efficient and not use brute-force methods.",
