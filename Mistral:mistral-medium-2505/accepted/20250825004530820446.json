    "challenge_prompt": "You are given a sequence of integers where each integer represents a step in a hidden pattern. Your task is to decode the pattern and compute the next integer in the sequence. The sequence is as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 22, 155, ?. To solve this, you must identify the underlying rule governing the sequence and write a Python function to compute the next term. The function should take the last two terms of the sequence as input and return the next term. Use the Python execution tool to verify your solution and return the next term as a single integer.",
