    "challenge_prompt": "Consider a sequence transformation process. Given an initial sequence of integers, the next sequence is generated by taking the absolute difference between consecutive elements of the previous sequence. For example, if the initial sequence is [4, 9, 2, 1, 7, 5], the next sequence is [|4-9|, |9-2|, |2-1|, |1-7|, |7-5|] = [5, 7, 1, 6, 2]. This process is repeated 'n' times. Your task is to write a Python function that takes an initial sequence and an integer 'n' as input, and returns the first element of the nth transformed sequence. If at any point the sequence becomes empty, return 0. What is the first element of the 10th transformed sequence of the initial sequence [4, 9, 2, 1, 7, 5]?",
