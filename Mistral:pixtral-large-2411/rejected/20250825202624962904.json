Your task is to decode the message and extract a single integer \"password\" from it.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Convert each number in the sequence to its corresponding letter in the alphabet (e.g., 1 -> A, 2 -> B, ..., 26 -> Z).\n2. Rearrange the letters to form a meaningful sentence.\n3. Extract the integer \"password\" from the decoded sentence.\n\n**Example:**\nIf the sequence were `1, 15, 9, 9, 12, 5, 14`, it would decode to \"AOIILDE\", which can be rearranged to \"ALOHA DIEL\". The integer \"password\" in this case would be derived from the sentence.\n\n**Your Task:**\nDecode the given sequence and find the integer \"password\".",
