    "challenge_prompt": "You are given a sequence of numbers: `[12, 23, 31, 47, 53, 61, 79, 83, 97, 101]`. This sequence follows a specific mathematical pattern. Your task is to identify the pattern and determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nTo solve this, you must:\n1. Analyze the sequence to identify the underlying pattern.\n2. Write a Python function that takes the sequence as input and returns the next number in the sequence.\n3. Ensure your solution is computationally efficient and completes within 5 seconds.\n\nThe final answer is a single integer, which is the next number in the sequence.",
