    "challenge_prompt": "The Enigmatic Sequence: You are given a sequence of integers that follows a specific pattern. The sequence is defined by the following rules: 1. The first term of the sequence is always 1. 2. Each subsequent term is derived from the previous term using a specific mathematical operation. 3. The operation involves squaring the previous term, adding the position index (1-based) of the term, and then taking the modulus of 1000. Your task is to find the 100th term of this sequence.",
