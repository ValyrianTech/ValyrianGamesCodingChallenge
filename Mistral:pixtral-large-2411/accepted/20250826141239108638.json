    "challenge_prompt": "You are given a sequence of integers representing the heights of buildings in a city. The sequence is guaranteed to be a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward). However, one building in the sequence has been 'flipped,' meaning its height has been negated (multiplied by -1). Your task is to identify the index (1-based) of the flipped building.\n\nFor example, if the sequence is `[3, 2, 5, 2, 3]`, and the flipped building is at index 3, the sequence would appear as `[3, 2, -5, 2, 3]`.\n\nWrite a Python function `find_flipped_building(heights)` that takes a list of integers `heights` and returns the 1-based index of the flipped building.\n\n**Constraints:**\n1. The length of the sequence will be between 3 and 1000.\n2. The heights of the buildings will be integers between -1000 and 1000.\n3. The sequence will always be a palindrome except for the one flipped building.\n4. The flipped building will always be unique (no other building will have the same height but opposite sign).\n\n**Input:** A list of integers representing the heights of the buildings.\n**Output:** An integer representing the 1-based index of the flipped building.\n\n--- \n\n**Example:**\nInput: `[3, 2, -5, 2, 3]`\nOutput: `3`",
