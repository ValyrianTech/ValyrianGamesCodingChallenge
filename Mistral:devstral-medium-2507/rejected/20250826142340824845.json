    "challenge_prompt": "You are given a string that represents a sequence of operations on a number. The operations are as follows:\n- 'D' means double the number\n- 'I' means increment the number by 1\n- 'S' means square the number\n\nYour task is to write a function that takes a string of operations and returns the final number after all operations have been applied. The initial number is 0.\n\nFor example, if the input string is 'DIS', the operations would be:\n- Double 0 to get 0\n- Increment 0 to get 1\n- Square 1 to get 1\n\nSo the function should return 1.\n\nWrite a function that takes a string of operations and returns the final number after all operations have been applied.\n\nYour function should be able to handle strings of up to 1000 operations.\n\nThe final answer to the challenge is the result of applying the operations 'DISDISDISDISDIS' to the initial number 0.",
