    "challenge_prompt": "Below is a mysterious message. Hidden within are several numbers, each encoded as the sum of the Unicode code points of the letters in a word that immediately follows a word starting with a capital letter and ending with a vowel.\n\nYour Task:\n1. For each word in the message that immediately follows a word starting with a capital letter and ending with a vowel, calculate the sum of the Unicode code points of its letters (ignore punctuation).\n2. Collect all such numbers in order.\n3. Compute the product of all collected numbers.\n4. Finally, return the remainder when this product is divided by 10007.\n\nMysterious Message:\nOnce upon a time, in a land far away, Alice explored the valley. Every evening, she would gaze at the horizon. Over hills and under stars, Eliza would sing softly. Only after sunrise, Isaac baked bread. Occasionally, Oscar painted rivers.\n\nWhat is the final integer?",
