    "challenge_prompt": "You are tasked with deciphering a sequence based on 'Fibonacci Words'. A Fibonacci Word sequence F(n) is defined as follows:\n*   F(0) = \"a\"\n*   F(1) = \"b\"\n*   F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1 (concatenation of strings).\n\nFor example:\n*   F(0) = \"a\"\n*   F(1) = \"b\"\n*   F(2) = \"ba\"\n*   F(3) = \"bab\"\n*   F(4) = \"babba\"\n*   F(5) = \"babbabab\"\n\nYour mission is to find the *index* (0-based) of the `K`-th occurrence of a specific character (`'a'` or `'b'`) within the Fibonacci Word `F(N)`.\n\nConstraints:\n*   `0 <= N <= 90` (F(90) is very long, but its length fits in a 64-bit integer, and character counts will too).\n*   `1 <= K <= count_of_char_in_F(N)` (K will always be valid).\n*   The character to search for will be either `'a'` or `'b'`.\n\nThe specific challenge parameters are:\n*   `N = 80`\n*   `K = 1234567890`\n*   `Character = 'a'`\n\nYour task is to return the 0-based index of the 1,234,567,890th occurrence of 'a' in F(80).\n\nComputational Efficiency Note: Due to the extreme length of F(80), you *must not* construct the string explicitly. Your solution should use a more efficient approach, likely involving pre-calculating lengths and character counts.",
