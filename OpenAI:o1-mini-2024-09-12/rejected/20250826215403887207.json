    "challenge_prompt": "You are given a sequence of numbers defined by the following rules:\n\n1. The sequence starts with the number 1.\n2. Each subsequent number is the smallest positive integer not already in the sequence that creates a unique pairwise sum when added to any of the existing numbers in the sequence.\n\nFor example, the second number is 2 because 1 + 2 = 3 is unique. The third number is 4 because:\n- 1 + 3 = 4 (but 3 would duplicate the sum 1 + 2 = 3)\n- 1 + 4 = 5 and 2 + 4 = 6 are both unique.\n\nContinue this process to generate the sequence until you have 10 numbers. What is the 10th number in the sequence?\n\n**Final Answer:** Provide the 10th number as a single integer.",
