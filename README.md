# Valyrian Games: Olympics of AI

**The Ultimate AI Model Benchmarking Platform**

Welcome to the Valyrian Games, an advanced AI benchmarking system that evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) through rigorous coding challenges. This platform serves as the "Olympics of AI," providing comprehensive performance analytics, cost analysis, and qualification metrics for AI models across multiple providers.

## üéØ System Overview

The Valyrian Games platform is a sophisticated benchmarking ecosystem designed to:

- **Automatically generate coding challenges** using AI models
- **Validate challenge quality** through multi-attempt solving
- **Track comprehensive performance metrics** including cost, speed, and accuracy
- **Provide executive-grade analytics** with professional visualizations
- **Support automated model qualification** based on performance thresholds
- **Enable cost-aware model selection** for optimal resource utilization

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of four core components working in harmony:

### 1. **Challenge Generation & Execution** (`run_coding_challenge_phase_1.py`)
The foundation script that orchestrates the complete challenge workflow:

- **Docker Environment Management**: Automatically restarts containers for clean execution
- **Challenge Creation**: Generates unique coding problems using specified LLM models
- **Multi-Attempt Validation**: Tests each challenge multiple times to ensure solvability
- **Performance Tracking**: Records tokens, costs, timing, and accuracy metrics
- **Automated Classification**: Sorts results into `accepted/` or `rejected/` directories
- **Statistics Integration**: Automatically triggers analysis updates after completion

**Key Features:**
- Configurable validation attempts (default: 3)
- Adjustable success thresholds (default: 50%)
- Timeout handling with graceful failure recording
- Comprehensive conversation metrics extraction
- Real-time progress monitoring with detailed logging

### 2. **Intelligent Model Selection** (`run_random_coding_challenge.py`)
Advanced orchestration system for automated testing across the entire model fleet:

- **Cost-Aware Selection**: Prioritizes cheaper models and those with fewer existing challenges
- **Dynamic Disqualification**: Two-tier system removes poorly performing models
  - **Early Disqualification**: ‚â•3 rejected challenges with 0 accepted
  - **Statistical Disqualification**: <50% acceptance rate after 10+ challenges
- **Weighted Random Selection**: Balances data collection across models using cost and challenge count
- **Qualified Model Pool**: Automatically loads qualified models from cost analysis data
- **Batch Execution**: Supports multiple runs with configurable delays
- **Auto-Visualization**: Generates updated charts after successful runs

**Supported Model Providers:**
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, O1, O3, O4 series (62+ models)
- **Anthropic**: Claude Opus, Sonnet, Haiku series
- **Google**: Gemini 2.5, 2.0, 1.5 series
- **Mistral**: Magistral, Codestral, Devstral, Ministral series
- **DeepSeek**: Chat and reasoning models
- **Together.ai**: DeepSeek-R1, Qwen, GLM, Llama variants
- **Groq**: High-speed inference models

### 3. **Comprehensive Analytics Engine** (`analyze_challenge_statistics.py`)
Sophisticated statistical analysis system that processes all challenge results:

- **Multi-Dimensional Metrics**: Acceptance rate, success rate, cost efficiency, token usage
- **Nested Directory Support**: Handles complex provider structures (Together.ai, Groq)
- **Qualification Determination**: Automatic model qualification based on performance criteria
- **Cost Summary Generation**: Creates `model_cost_summary.json` for downstream systems
- **Executive Reporting**: Generates detailed markdown reports with model rankings
- **Auto-Visualization Trigger**: Launches chart generation after analysis completion

**Generated Outputs:**
- `qualification_results.md`: Comprehensive performance report
- `model_cost_summary.json`: Structured data for visualizations and model selection
