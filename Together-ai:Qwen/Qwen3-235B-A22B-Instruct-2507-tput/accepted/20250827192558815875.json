    "challenge_prompt": "Find the 2024th term in a modified look-and-say sequence defined as follows:\n\n- Start with the string \"1\"\n- Each subsequent term is generated by reading the previous term aloud, grouping consecutive identical digits, and writing down the count followed by the digit (this is the standard look-and-say rule)\n- After generating each term, convert it to an integer and take the value modulo 1009\n- Return the resulting value at the 2024th term\n\nExample of sequence generation:\n1 -> \"one 1\" -> 11\n11 -> \"two 1s\" -> 21\n21 -> \"one 2, one 1\" -> 1211\n1211 -> \"one 1, one 2, two 1s\" -> 111221\n\nNote: The first term is at index 1. You need to compute the 2024th term after applying the modulo operation at each step.",
