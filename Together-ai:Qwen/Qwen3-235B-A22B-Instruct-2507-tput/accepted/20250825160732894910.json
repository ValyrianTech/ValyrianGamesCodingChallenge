    "challenge_prompt": "You are given a string initially composed of 17 'a's, followed by 11 'b's, and 5 'c's. A transformation rule is applied repeatedly until the string no longer changes: whenever two adjacent characters are identical, they are replaced by a single instance of the next letter in the alphabet (with 'z' wrapping to 'a'). For example, 'aa' becomes 'b', 'bb' becomes 'c', and 'zz' becomes 'a'. The transformation is applied greedily from left to right in each pass. Your task is to determine the length of the final string after no more transformations can be applied. Write a Python function to simulate this process and return the length of the resulting string as an integer.",
