    "challenge_prompt": "A 'mountain number' is a number where the digits first strictly increase to a peak and then strictly decrease. The number must have exactly 7 digits, with no leading zeros and no repeated digits. For example, 1234321 is a mountain number, but 123321 is not (due to repeated '3'), and 123214 is not (it does not strictly decrease after the peak).\n\nYour task is to compute the total number of 7-digit mountain numbers that can be formed using digits from 1 to 9 (0 is not allowed, as it would violate the strictly increasing/decreasing property or cause a leading zero).\n\nUse combinatorial reasoning to solve this efficiently. The answer must be computed and returned as a single integer.",
