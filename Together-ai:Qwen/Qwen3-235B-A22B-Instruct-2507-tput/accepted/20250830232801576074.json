(n factorial) ends with exactly 100 zeros.\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in n!. Since 10 = 2 \u00d7 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in n!, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 5.\n\nThe formula to compute the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\nfloor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + floor(n/625) + ...\n\nYour task is to find the smallest n for which this sum equals exactly 100.\n\nUse efficient reasoning or code to solve this \u2014 brute force methods may be too slow.",
