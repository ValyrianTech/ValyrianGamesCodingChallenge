For any term after that (n > 2), the value is determined by adding the previous term and the term at position floor(n/2). For example, the 3rd term is the 2nd term plus the 1st term (2 + 1 = 3), and the 4th term is the 3rd term plus the 2nd term (3 + 2 = 5). What is the value of the 100th term in this sequence?",
