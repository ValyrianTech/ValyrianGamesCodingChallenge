    "challenge_prompt": "You're given a sequence of numbers generated by a mysterious rule. Your task is to determine the next number in the sequence. Sequence: 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, ? However, there's a twist: the sequence is not just about the numbers themselves but how they're represented. Look closely at the number of letters in the English spelling of each number. Example: 'One' has 3 letters, 'Two' has 3 letters, 'Four' has 4 letters, 'Seven' has 5 letters, 'Eleven' has 6 letters. Upon closer inspection, you'll notice that the sequence is related to the number of letters in the spelling of the numbers in order, but it's not directly the count of letters. Instead, it's related to a simple operation on these counts. Determine the next number in the given sequence (1, 2, 4, 7, 11, ?) by figuring out the rule. Provide the next number in the sequence as your answer.",
