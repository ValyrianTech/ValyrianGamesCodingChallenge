### Coding Challenge Creation Prompt for LLMs

**Task Overview:**
You are a large language model (LLM) with access to a Python code execution tool. Your goal is to design a coding challenge that pushes the limits of your own problem-solving abilities. This challenge will be presented to multiple LLMs (including yourself, but with no memory of having created it).

**Instructions & Requirements:**

1. **Creativity & Difficulty:**
   - Create a challenge that is as difficult as possible, but still solvable by you as the creator.
   - You may use any topic, logic, or mechanism (e.g., code puzzles, riddles, trivia, multi-step reasoning, etc.).
2. **Single Integer Output:**
   - The final answer to the challenge must be a single integer, which serves as a "password" for a correct solution.
3. **Python Execution:**
   - You and all other LLMs will have access to a Python code execution tool to solve the challenge.
4. **Verification:**
   - When creating your challenge, you must use the run_python_code tool yourself to solve it and verify the answer before submission.
5. **Forgetting Constraint:**
   - You will not remember the challenge you created when it is presented for solving.
6. **Submission Contents:**
   - Provide the challenge prompt (as it will be presented to solvers).
   - Write the Python code to solve your own challenge and run it.

**Process:**

- **Reflect:** Before writing your challenge, think about how to make it uniquely challenging and creative.
- **Design:** Write the challenge prompt clearly and concisely.
- **Solve & Verify:** Use the Python execution tool to solve your challenge and obtain the answer.
- **Submit:** Present the challenge prompt, your Python solution code, and the verified integer answer.

**Computational Efficiency Requirements:**

- **CRITICAL: Avoid Computationally Intensive Tasks**
  - Your challenge MUST NOT require excessive computational resources or execution time.
  - Solutions should complete within 5 seconds on standard hardware.
  - Total memory usage should remain under 100MB.

- **Specifically AVOID:**
  - Large-scale matrix operations or tensor computations
  - Brute force approaches requiring millions of iterations
  - Recursive algorithms with deep call stacks
  - Processing or generating large datasets (>10,000 elements)
  - Complex simulations with many iterations
  - Image or video processing operations
  - Training machine learning models
  - Cryptographic operations requiring significant work (e.g., mining)
  - Nested loops with O(nÂ³) complexity or worse

- **PREFER Instead:**
  - Clever algorithmic insights that reduce computational complexity
  - Mathematical reasoning and pattern recognition
  - Logic puzzles that require insight rather than brute force
  - Problems that can be solved with dynamic programming in reasonable time
  - Challenges based on understanding code behavior rather than heavy computation
  - String manipulation and parsing with reasonably sized inputs
  - Graph problems with small to medium-sized graphs (<1000 nodes)

**Tips:**
- You may include obfuscation, multi-step logic, or require lateral thinking.
- You may combine programming, general knowledge, and reasoning.
- Ensure the challenge is fair and solvable with the information provided.
- Focus on intellectual difficulty rather than computational intensity.
- Test your solution with small inputs first before scaling to the final problem.
